# Black Pearl Coach Charters and Tours - Admin Dashboard Development Update

## Current Status: Admin Pages Added

I have successfully added the frontend files for the **Admin Dashboard**. This includes the following pages, all using the new dark, vertical sidebar layout:

* `admin.html` (Dashboard Overview)
* `admin-bookings.html`
* `admin-tours.html`
* `admin-messages.html`
* `admin-gallery.html`
* `admin-settings.html`

***

## Known Issues / Immediate Next Steps

**The frontend is not yet perfect.** We need to finalize minor CSS adjustments for alignment and responsiveness across all pages, particularly the complex tables in `admin-bookings.html` and `admin-tours.html`.

## Backend Integration Instructions (Important for Developers)

Please note the following regarding data handling:

* **Dummy Data:** The tables and fields currently display **dummy inputs**. No data is being stored or processed yet.
* **Data Reflection:** When developing the backend logic for the customer-facing pages (e.g., Quote requests, User registration, Contact form submissions), **all data operations MUST reflect on the corresponding Admin pages.**
    * *Example:* A successful quote submission (`quote.html`) must result in a new entry appearing in the `admin-bookings.html` or `admin-messages.html` database table/view.
